# NYC CITI Bike

Following the work of [Todd W. Schneider] (http://toddwschneider.com/posts/a-tale-of-twenty-two-million-citi-bikes-analyzing-the-nyc-bike-share-system/), I planned to give this dataset a shot. 

Any data about NYC excites me as it is the city I live close to. I will update this repo with my interesting obervations.
